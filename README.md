I developed a classic Snake Game using Java AWT and Swing, leveraging Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts for a structured and modular codebase. The game lets players control a snake to collect food items, with each successful collection causing the snake to grow longer and the game difficulty to increase, adding a fun challenge.

Key features include:

User-Friendly Interface: Designed a simple yet engaging GUI using Java Swing components, making it easy to play and visually appealing.
Smooth Animation and Real-Time Scoring: Implemented smooth movement for the snake, dynamic score tracking, and seamless gameplay to enhance user experience.
Collision Detection: Integrated collision detection logic for both the walls and the snake's body, ending the game upon impact, which reinforces the challenge.
Event Handling: Utilized Java AWT for effective event handling, allowing responsive controls for the snake's movement.
Scalable Difficulty: As the snake grows, gameplay becomes more challenging, providing an engaging experience that keeps players returning for more.
This project showcases my skills in Java GUI programming, event-driven design, and applying OOP principles to create interactive applications.
